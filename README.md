ExTrack
-------

This repository contains the necessary scripts to run the method ExTrack. ExTrack is a method to detemine kinetics of particles able to transition between different motion states. It can assess diffusion coefficients, transition rates, localization error as well as annotating the probability for any track to be in each state for every time points. It can produce histograms of durations in each state to highlight none-markovian transition kinetics. Eventually it can be used to refine the localization precision of tracks by considering the most likely positions which is especially efficient when the particle do not move.

More details on the methods are available on BioarXiv https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2022.07.13.499913v1.

ExTrack has been designed and implemented by Fran√ßois Simon in the laboratory of Sven van Teeffelen at University of Montreal. ExTrack is primarely implemented as a python package but we are also planning to release a stand alone version of the algorithm soon.

See the Wiki section for more information on how to install and use ExTrack.

https://pypi.org/project/extrack/

# Dependencies

- numpy
- lmfit
- xmltodict
- matplotlib
- pandas

Optional: jupyter, cupy

# Installation (from pip)

(needs to be run in anaconda prompt for anaconda users on windows)

## Install dependencies

`pip install numpy lmfit xmltodict matplotlib pandas`

## Install ExTrack

`pip install extrack`

https://pypi.org/project/extrack/

the current version (1.5) has working but oudated version of the position refinement method. It may only work for 2-state models. This will be updated as soon as possible.

## Input file format

ExTrack can deal with tracks saved with TrackMate xml format or csv format by using the integrated readers https://github.com/vanTeeffelenLab/ExTrack/wiki/Loading-data-sets.

# Installation from this GitHub repository

## From Unix/Mac:

`sudo apt install git` (if git is not installed)

`git clone https://github.com/vanTeeffelenLab/ExTrack.git`

`cd ExTrack`

`sudo python setup.py install`

## From Windows using anaconda prompt:

Need to install git if not already installed.

`git clone https://github.com/vanTeeffelenLab/ExTrack.git` One can also just manually download the package if git is not installed. Once extracted the folder may be named ExTrack-main

`cd ExTrack` or cd `ExTrack-main`

`python setup.py install` from the ExTrack directory

# Tutorial

Tutorials for the python package of ExTrack are available.

A first tutorial allows the user to have an overview of all the possibilities of the different modules of ExTrack (https://github.com/vanTeeffelenLab/ExTrack/blob/main/Tutorials/Tutorial_ExTrack.ipynb). This jupyter notebook tutorial shows the whole pipeline:
- Loading data sets (https://github.com/vanTeeffelenLab/ExTrack/wiki/Loading-data-sets).
- Initialize parameters of the model (https://github.com/vanTeeffelenLab/ExTrack/wiki/Parameters-for-fitting).
- Fitting.
- Probabilistic state annotation.
- Histograms of state duration.
- Position refinement.
- Saving results.

from loading data sets to saving results
at these location: 
- tests/test_extrack.py
- or Tutorials/tutorial_extrack.ipynb

These contain the most important modules in a comprehensive framework. We recommand following the tutorial tutorial_extrack.ipynb which uses Jupyter notebook as it is more didactic. One has to install jupyter to use it: `pip install jupyter` in the anaconda prompt for conda users.

# Usage
## Units
The distance units of the parameters (input and output) are the same unit as the units of the tracks. Our initial parameters are chosen to work for micron units but initial parameters can be changed to match other units. The rate parameters are rates per frame. Rates per second can be inferred from the rates per frame by dividing them by the time in between frames.

## Main functions

extrack.tracking.param_fitting : performs the fit to infer the parameters of a given data set.

extrack.visualization.visualize_states_durations : plot histograms of the duration in each state.

extrack.tracking.predict_Bs : predicts the states of the tracks.

## Extra functions

extrack.simulate_tracks.sim_FOV : allows to simulate tracks.

extrack.exporters.extrack_2_pandas : turn the outputs from ExTrack to a pandas dataframe. outputed dataframe can be save with dataframe.to_csv(save_path)

extrack.exporters.save_extrack_2_xml : save extrack data to xml file (trackmate format).

extrack.visualization.visualize_tracks : show all tracks in a single plot.

extrack.visualization.plot_tracks : show the longest tracks on separated plots

# Parallelization

Multiple CPU Parallelization can be performed in get_2DSPT_params with the argument worker the number of cores used for the job (equal to 1 by default).
Warning: Do not work on windows.

GPU parallelization used to be available but may not be compatible with the current CPU parallelization, GPU parallelization uses the package cupy which can be installed as described here : https://github.com/cupy/cupy. The cupy version will depend on your cuda version which itself must be compatible with your GPU driver and GPU. Usage of cupy requires a change in the module extrack/tracking (line 4) : GPU_computing = True

# to do

- Redo the script for Refined positions to match the current version.
- Try approximations based on 'm' and 's' values instead of fixed window length.
